# Player Behaviour Tracking Paper Collection

This mini-project provides an accessible list of peer-reviewed articles which present analyses of gambling transactions.
Only studies which focus on the analysis of the tranasctions themselves, as opposed to work pulling in other data sources (like surveys or lab studies), are included.
This is to keep the list manageable (there's a lot of important work out there which is really interesting), and to give users of the gamba library a concise list of existing work.

**NOTE**

This is also a mini-project to practice using github's branch/PR system :)
